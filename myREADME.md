Name: Day Planner

Description: 
The page has 9 rows for each  hour in a 9:00-5:00 hour work day There are textareas in each row that allow the user to input whatever they so choose. They can then save their inputs by clicking the calendar button to the right of the textarea. This will allow the user to save their inputs to local storage and retain their inputs even if they leave the page. The current date is displayed at the top of the page and is maintained by moment.js. Additionally textareas will change color depending on if the corresponding hour is past, present, or future. 


Here is a live link to the day planner. https://cnperkins.github.io/DayPlanner/ 8/13/2020.

I've added some images of what it looks like in the assets folder.

Thank you for checking out my day planner!
